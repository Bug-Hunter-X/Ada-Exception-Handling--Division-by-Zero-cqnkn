# Ada Exception Handling: Division by Zero

This example demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: not handling exceptions properly. Specifically, it focuses on the division by zero exception.

The `bug.ada` file contains code that attempts to divide by zero.  The `bugSolution.ada` file provides a corrected version that gracefully handles the exception.

## How to Run

1.  Save the code in the respective `.ada` files.
2.  Compile and run the code using an Ada compiler (like GNAT).
